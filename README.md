# Gallery-project
 
 I built this project with vanilla js.
 
 # Why a gallery app?
 
 Well I was looking for ideas for intermediate javascript websites and I said why not?
 
 Very challenging, I spend 2 days trying to figure it out how hide some components while showing others.
 
 # What did i learn?
 
 A lot, even though it's a very small web app.
 
 I learned how to use google when I was stuck with a problem.
 
 How to try out different types of solutions.
